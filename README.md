## :notes: About Me
A simple person, but friendly and happy even with small things.

### What I Believe In:
- I believe in the saying that if you do something wrong, there is karma to compensate.
- If you plant something, you will reap something. It's like studying, if you work hard, you will achieve something.
- Work hard and always believe in God, because I believe that we can also achieve our own dreams if we do this. :milky_way:
