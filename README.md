## :notes: About Me
I'm just a simple, happy person who appreciates the small things and enjoys being around people.

### What I Believe In:
- I believe that when you do something wrong, karma will make things right in the end.
- What you plant is what you harvest. So if you work hard at studying, you're bound to achieve something.
- Work hard and keep your faith â€“ I believe that's the way to make your dreams come true. :milky_way:

I'm a student who's always looking to **learn and experience** new things.
